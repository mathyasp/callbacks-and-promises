const lion = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    reject("Lion sleeps through race");
  }, 1000);
});

const hare = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    reject("Hare is too busy eating and misses race");
  }, 2000);
});

const tortise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

// Challenge!

// Test the code above. Explain what happens below:
// The tortise wins because it resolves first, while the others are all rejected. It seems that .any() only resolves if at least one promise resolves.

// Notice this example is the same as the last with the difference
// that this time you are using Promise.any() instead of Promise.race()
// Also notice that the first two racers should reject and should 
// do that before the last racer (Tortise resolves at 3000ms, while the 
// first two reslove in 1000ms, and 200ms)
