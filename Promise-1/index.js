// **Problems to solve**

// **1)** What happens when a promise is rejected? Test it by calling `reject()`
// The promise fails, and passes the reason for the failure to the `catch` method.

// **2)** What happens when you call both `resolve` and `reject`? Test this.
// The reject method is used but not the resolve method.

// **3)** Does the order matter you call resolve and reject matter? Test this. 
// Yes, the order matters. Whichever is called first gets used and the other is skipped.

// **4)** What happens if you call `resolve` or `reject` more than once? Test this out for yourself.
// The first one called is used and the rest are ignored.
